```haskell
import Data.List (sort)
import Data.Ord (comparing)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let xs = [1, "hello", 3, 4, 5]
  -- Attempting to sort xs directly will cause a runtime error
  -- let ys = sort xs
  -- print ys

  -- Solution: Use a type class to handle different types within the list.
  -- We can't sort directly if there are different types. To handle this,
  -- we may need to apply a function that returns an ordering on each element
  -- before sorting them. This could look like:
  let ys = sortOn show xs -- using show as a fallback, however a better way would be required
  print ys

-- Better approach:  Handle different types explicitly.
-- Instead of directly sorting, we'd first filter to homogeneous sublists.

sortOn :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [a]
sortOn f = sort . map (
 x -> (f x, x)) >> map snd 
-- This utilizes a lambda function to pair the sort function's result to the original value, allowing us to sort while maintaining
-- the original values. The map snd function then retrieves the original values.
